Todo:
-   Once I learn Javascript, get rid of ugly links and use buttons instead.  Then other logical paths can be cleaner as well.
-   CSS improvements, including replacing raw text links with svg fonts (like thumbs up/down for like/unlike)
-   Add "more comments" button to show more than 3 comments per post
